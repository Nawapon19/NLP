# NLP_Practice

This repo is for keeping my NLP practice exercises.

1. Practice Stemming and Lemmatization using NLTK library - Natural Language Toolkit

2. Count Vectorizer Practice using NLTK library
   * Apply count vectorizer to text dataset
   * then training the MultinomialNB model with the data with no preprocessing, remove stopwords, lemmatization, stemming, and string.split
   * Make prediction with testing data then compare the accuracy scores

3. TFIDF Recommender System Practice
   * Create a simple recommender system with TF-IDF vectorizer using movie text dataset

4. TFIDF From Scratch
   * Practice building TF-IDF vectorizer from scratch using bbc text classification dataset
   * Randomly select text in dataset to predict the label and print top 5 terms

5. Word Embeddings Demo Practice using Word2Vec and GloVe

6. Detecting Spam Emails Using Tensorflow in Python
   * Practice Neural Network with Embedding layers using spam emails dataset
   * Practice removing punctuations and stopwords
  
7. SMS Spam Detection using TensorFlow
   * Practice building MiltinomialNB as a baseline model then try to beat its performance using deep learning models
   * i.e. Custom Text Vectorization with Embedding Model, Bidirectional-LSTM Model, and USE-Transfer learning Model
   * Compare the model performances using accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and F-1 score
  
8. Autocorrector Feature Using NLP In Python
   * Practice building a simple autocorrector model using Python
   * Print the top 3 correct words with the most appears in the dataset from an input word
   * The model gives poor result on the prediction
